# Project---Image-Classification-with-Pre-trained-Keras-models-
Welcome to this project on Image Classification with Pre-trained Keras models. This project aims to impart the knowledge of how to access the pre-trained models(here we get pre-trained ResNet model) from Keras of TensorFlow 2, and appreciate its powerful classification capacity by making the model predict the class of an input image.
